# BigVGAN

A Universal Neural Vocoder with Large-Scale Training.

A Big Vocoding GAN that enables high-fidelity out-of-distribution (OOD) generation without fine-tuning.

The training process aborted with the following exception after 40715 steps:

```
librosa.util.exceptions.ParameterError: Input must be finite
```

No where to file issue in the repo, so sent an email to the author. Will update if there is any feedback.

Synthesis looks ok.

Please refer to BigVGAN.ipynb.

The dataset is 97G in size.

It requires 4 CPUs/24G RAM/1 GPU.
