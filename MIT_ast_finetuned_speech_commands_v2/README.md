The Audio Spectrogram Transformer is equivalent to [ViT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/vit), but applied on audio. Audio is first turned into an image (as a spectrogram), after which a Vision Transformer is applied. The model gets state-of-the-art results on several audio classification benchmarks.

It requires 2 CPUs/4G RAM, but no GPU.
