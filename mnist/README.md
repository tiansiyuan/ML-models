This is a simple convolutional neural network in PyTorch and train it to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. Training a classifier on the MNIST dataset can be regarded as the hello world of image recognition.

Please refer to:

- mnist.ipynb

It uses PyTorch framework and requires 0.5 CPU/1G RAM, but no GPU.

- MNIST-Tensorboard.ipynb

It uses Tensorflow framework and requires 1 CPU/4G RAM, no GPU.
