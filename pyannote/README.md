# speaker diarization with pyannote.audio

`pyannote.audio` is an open-source toolkit written in Python for speaker diarization. Based on PyTorch machine learning framework, it provides a set of trainable end-to-end neural building blocks that can be combined and jointly optimized to build speaker diarization pipelines.

`pyannote.audio` also comes with pretrained models and pipelines covering a wide range of domains for voice activity detection, speaker segmentation, overlapped speech detection, speaker embedding reaching state-of-the-art performance for most of them. 

Please refer to pyannote.ipynb

It requires 2 CPUs/4G RAM, with or without GPU.
