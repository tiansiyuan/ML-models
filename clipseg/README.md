# ClipSeg

The CLIPSeg model was proposed in [Image Segmentation Using Text and Image Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10003) by Timo LÃ¼ddecke and Alexander Ecker. CLIPSeg adds a minimal decoder on top of a frozen CLIP model for zero- and one-shot image segmentation.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

Image segmentation is usually addressed by training a model for a fixed set of object classes. Incorporating additional classes or more complex queries later is expensive as it requires re-training the model on a dataset that encompasses these expressions. Here we propose a system that can generate image segmentations based on arbitrary prompts at test time. A prompt can be either a text or an image. This approach enables us to create a unified model (trained once) for three common segmentation tasks, which come with distinct challenges: referring expression segmentation, zero-shot segmentation and one-shot segmentation. We build upon the CLIP model as a backbone which we extend with a transformer-based decoder that enables dense prediction. After training on an extended version of the PhraseCut dataset, our system generates a binary segmentation map for an image based on a free-text prompt or on an additional image expressing the query. We analyze different variants of the latter image-based prompts in detail. This novel hybrid input allows for dynamic adaptation not only to the three segmentation tasks mentioned above, but to any binary segmentation task where a text or image query can be formulated. Finally, we find our system to adapt well to generalized queries involving affordances or properties.

This tutorial shows you with a Jupyter notebook how to run this model for image segmentation.

Steps to run the example:

1. Create a new notebook server on **Kubeflow on vSphere** dashboard with 2 CPUs and 4G RAM using custom Docker image `projects.registry.vmware.com/models/notebook/inference:cv-pytorch-cpu-v3`. GPU is not needed. 

2. `CONNECT` to the notebook server and launch a Terminal in the created notebook server.

3. Download the Jupyter notebook in the Terminal via command: 

   ```shell
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NielsRogge/Transformers-Tutorials/master/CLIPSeg/Zero_shot_image_segmentation_with_CLIPSeg.ipynb
   ```

4. Open the downloaded notebook and run the cells in the notebook to reproduce the results.
