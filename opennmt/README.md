# OpenNMT

OpenNMT is an open source ecosystem for neural machine translation and neural sequence learning. OpenNMT provides implementations in 2 popular deep learning frameworks:

- OpenNMT-py: User-friendly and multimodal, benefiting from PyTorch ease of use.
- OpenNMT-tf: Modular and stable, powered by the Tensorflow ecosystem.

Here we are using OpenNMT-py. Please refer to

- OpenNMT.ipynb: French -> English
- OpenNMT-zh.ipynb: Chinese -> English


It requires 4 CPUs/12G RAM/1 GPU.
