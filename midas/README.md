# MiDAS

[MiDaS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01341) computes relative inverse depth from a single image. The repository provides multiple models that cover different use cases ranging from a small, high-speed model to a very large model that provide the highest accuracy. The models have been trained on 10 distinct datasets using multi-objective optimization to ensure high quality on a wide range of inputs.

This tutorial shows you the *image resize and normalize* capabilities of the model with a Jupyter notebook.

Steps to run the example:

1. Create a new notebook server on **Kubeflow on vSphere** dashboard with 2 CPUs and 4G RAM using custom Docker image `projects.registry.vmware.com/models/notebook/inference:cv-pytorch-cpu-v3`. GPU is not necessary.

2. `CONNECT` to the notebook server and launch a Terminal in the created notebook server.

3. Download the Jupyter notebooks in the Terminal via command: 

   ```shell
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vmware/vSphere-machine-learning-extension/master/examples/model_inference/cv/midas/MiDaS.ipynb
   ```

4. Open the downloaded notebook and run the cells in the notebook to reproduce the results.
