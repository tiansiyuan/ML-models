# MiDAS

[MiDaS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01341) computes relative inverse depth from a single image. The repository provides multiple models that cover different use cases ranging from a small, high-speed model to a very large model that provide the highest accuracy. The models have been trained on 10 distinct datasets using multi-objective optimization to ensure high quality on a wide range of inputs.

It requires 2 CPUs/4G RAM, no GPU. It could run on GPU.
