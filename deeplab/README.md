Deeplabv3-ResNet is constructed by a Deeplabv3 model using a ResNet-50 or ResNet-101 backbone. Deeplabv3-MobileNetV3-Large is constructed by a Deeplabv3 model using the MobileNetV3 large backbone. The pre-trained model has been trained on a subset of COCO train2017, on the 20 categories that are present in the Pascal VOC dataset.

It requires 1 CPU/2G RAM, no GPU.
